1. `POST /customers` – Create a customer (e.g., Ocean Exports)
2. `POST /branches` – Add a branch using `customer_id = 1`
3. `GET /customers/1` – Fetch customer along with its branches
4. `GET /branches` – List all branches (optional `customer_id` filter)
5. `DELETE /customers/1` – Remove customer (auto deletes branches)
